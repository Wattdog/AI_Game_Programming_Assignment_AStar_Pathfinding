# AI_Game_Programming_Assignment_AStar_Pathfinding

The program will take a created maze file with a .txt file type (e.g. file_name.txt). You will add this to the project folder and then launch the debugger. From there you can then enter the file name and the Algorithm will then work out the shortest path.

Currently the Algorithm will go from the start to the finish, but currently it will not present the shortest path it can take to reach the goal.
